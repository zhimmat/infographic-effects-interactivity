## Deliverables & milestones

### 1. Paper plan

*Due end of class week 13*

On paper, plan out the website’s interactivity & effects like we did in these activities:

- [Coding in English](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/courses/web-dev-3/coding-in-english)
- [Storyboarding effects](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/courses/web-dev-3/storyboarding-effects)

**Show the paper plan to Thomas by the end of class week 13. Late submissions or submissions not presented in person will not be accepted.**

### 2. Code milestone

*Due end of class week 14*

In class, during week 14 you must show Thomas progress on the interactivity & effects code. At this point the code should be far along.

**Show the working website to Thomas by the end of class week 14. Late submissions or submissions not presented in person will not be accepted.**

### 3. Browser testing

*Due end of class week 15*

In class, during week 15, we’ll be testing everybody’s website in different browsers to make sure they look good.

**You’ll be required to submit screenshots for your website for every browser listed.**

### 4. Request for grade

*Due last day of the term, Friday at midnight*

Since the goal of this project is to prove to me that you can do everything learned this term I want a written statement denoting your proof—and a grade you think you deserve.

The written explanation should be a list of things we learned this term that you applied to your website. **Most importantly how and why your website proves you can do the things we learned this term.** Explain to me **why** you deserve the grade you chose for yourself.

- Give yourself a grade for the project: F, C, B, A, A+<br>
- Write an explanation as to why the website shows you’ve learned and can apply everything from the term.
- Be honest with yourself and with me (I’ll notice if you’re not)

**I will read your explanation while looking over your websites. If your feedback is honest and just, you will receive the mark you chose.**

[**Submit the explanation to the Interactive effects & interactivity assignment on Canvas—there’s a text entry field.**](https://algonquin.instructure.com/courses/467503/assignments/4198988)

### 5. Final website

*Due last day of the term, Friday at midnight*

Drop this folder into your Markbot application. Make sure to fix all the errors. And submit to Canvas using Markbot.

**Markbot will give you 1/100—this is just a confirmation so you know that the URL was handed in properly—it is not your final mark.**
